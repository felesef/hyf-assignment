# Part 2: Reflection

## 1) Three new things I learned from AI
- AI helped me map a resume into **semantic HTML** (using `header`, `section`, `article`) and keep a clean **h1 → h2 → h3** heading hierarchy. 
- I should use very specific, and partially, step by step **prompts** to get what I want
- I is my helper/assistant, not my coder

## 2) Where I tweaked GPT suggestions
- I used it to: \
 -- Create boiler HTML plate.\
 -- Create JS methods and helpers.\
 -- Give hints about styling deeper.

## 3) GPT generating code vs. GPT as a learning partner
- Using GPT to **generate code** is about speed: it drafts scaffolds and repetitive markup quickly. \
- Using it as a **learning partner** means I ask for trade-offs, request explanations, compare alternatives, and iterate on the why—not just the what. In practice, I now treat GPT like a **pair programmer**: I review, question, and refine its output to deepen my understanding.

## 4) Three risks of relying too much on AI
The three big risks are: \
**(1) Shallow understanding**; (you accept code without knowing why)\
**(2) Hallucinations/insecure patterns**; that slip through if you don’t verify, and \
**(3) Over-dependence**; which weakens debugging and problem-solving skills. AI can also normalize style/structure so your portfolio looks less **original** if you don’t personalize. The fix is active review, testing, and always adding your own reasoning and voice.
