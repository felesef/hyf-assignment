Manti is one of my all-time favorite dishes from my homeland, Turkey. The marriage of the melt-in-the-mouth dumplings, filled with onion-scented ground beef, and served with creamy garlicky yogurt and spicy olive oil is simply irresistible. This rich, comforting, and unique Turkish specialty makes a fantastic main course for entertaining and sharing with family and friends.

Just as Italians have Potato Gnocchi and Ricotta Gnocchi, we Turks adore mantı and we have many regional varieties. It is a shared culinary heritage that the nomadic Turkish tribes brought with them when they traveled from Central Asia toward Anatolia in the 11th century. Many cultures throughout central and western Asia have versions of manti though they are shaped and served differently. This manti recipe is what I grew up with in Turkey.

The small handmade dumplings take time but it is worth all the effort, and it is a wonderful dish to make with friends and family. I have many fond memories of gathering around the table with my grandparents, mom and dad to enjoy the mantı-making ritual. Some would make the dough, some would prepare the filling and help fill the mantı dumplings, all with the constant flow of tea, coffee, and daily gossip. Happy memories! 

It’s a great make-ahead recipe as manti can be par-baked and then frozen to use at a later date.

Ingredients for Making Manti
Though manti takes time and care to prepare, the ingredients are rather simple and easy to source. Here is what you’ll need to make this manti recipe:

Dough Ingredients
Plain (all-purpose) flour: All-purpose plain flour is traditionally used in mantı dough.
Sea salt: Brings out the flavor of the dough.
Egg: Binds the dough and adds richness.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Olive oil is my choice of fat to achieve a nice, smooth dough, as it is both healthy and flavorful.
